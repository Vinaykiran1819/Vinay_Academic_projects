## Comprehensive Analysis of Public Health Trends in the United States
This project is a comprehensive statistical exploration of public health trends in the United States using the PLACES dataset. Utilizing R programming, the analysis includes data joining, creation of insightful tables and plots, and selection of a key health outcome through exploratory data analysis. Hypothesis testing was performed with both one-sample and two-sample tests. The modeling phase involved developing regression models with both full and reduced variables, as well as classification models, which were evaluated using error metrics and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Additionally, the project visualized the distribution of mean absolute errors to highlight regional variations in health outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis of Bangkok Airbnb Dataset
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Airbnb listings in Bangkok to prepare it for building a price prediction model. We started by sampling the data to create separate sets for training, testing, and validation. During the exploration phase, we handled missing values, explored data patterns through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, and visualized the data. We then modified the data by standardizing values, transforming data, analyzing outliers, and using principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality. This careful preparation helps in understanding the factors that influence pricing in Airbnb listings and sets the stage for accurate predictive modeling.

## EDA and Big Data Analytics for PPP and Census Data
This project leveraged PySpark to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) dataset, aiming to unearth important trends and understand the dataset’s characteristics effectively. Using PySpark’s robust data processing features, the project handled the downloading, loading, and preprocessing of the PPP data efficiently, ensuring clean and analysis-ready data. The comprehensive analysis included statistical methods and data visualization techniques to explore loan distributions, identify the most benefited sectors, and assess the geographical spread of loans. The insights gained from this analysis provided a clearer view of how the PPP program has been affecting different sectors and regions.

## Insurance Fraud Detection
In this project, I developed a robust fraud detection system for first-party physical damage claims within the insurance sector, focusing on claims from 2015 to 2016. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, I significantly improved detection metrics, achieving a 70% F1 score and a 60% accuracy—up from a baseline of 40%. This enhancement in fraud detection not only led to substantial cost savings but also increased customer trust by accurately identifying and preventing fraudulent claims.

## Optimization of Electronic Claim Submission
The project aimed at optimizing electronic claim submissions involved the creation of an automated business model designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of healthcare claim processing, benefiting patients, providers, and insurance companies. We developed and implemented a robust RDS database using DBeaver, crafted an Entity-Relationship Model, and executed data integration along with comprehensive performance evaluations to ensure optimal operation. Through strategic data optimization and performance tuning, we imported a significant amount of data and successfully halved the database query processing times, streamlining the claims process and markedly improving its efficiency. This initiative not only reduced the administrative burden but also improved financial transparency and patient care through more efficient and accurate claim processing.

Skills : DBMS, Business Process Modeling, SQL

## Predicting Diabetes Early Readmission in US Hospital
This project utilized a comprehensive dataset from 130 U.S. hospitals spanning 1999 to 2008 to develop a predictive model for early readmission among diabetes patients. By analyzing over 100,000 patient records, we aimed to enhance diabetes care efficiency and reduce healthcare costs. The model we developed demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, achieving a sensitivity of 70.85% and a specificity of 91%, with an AUC of 0.7. This translates to a significant improvement, marking a 250% increase in model performance from the baseline. Moreover, the model's predictive strength allowed for an estimated $28.16 million in healthcare savings, showcasing its substantial potential to cut costs while improving patient care outcomes.
