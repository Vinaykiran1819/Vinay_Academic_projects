## Comprehensive Analysis of Public Health Trends in the United States
This project is a comprehensive statistical exploration of public health trends in the United States using the PLACES dataset. Utilizing R programming, the analysis includes data joining, creation of insightful tables and plots, and selection of a key health outcome through exploratory data analysis. Hypothesis testing was performed with both one-sample and two-sample tests. The modeling phase involved developing regression models with both full and reduced variables, as well as classification models, which were evaluated using error metrics and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Additionally, the project visualized the distribution of mean absolute errors to highlight regional variations in health outcomes.
